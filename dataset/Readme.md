## Dataset
We used the MIMIC-CXR dataset for training and evaluation. The MIMIC-CXR dataset is a large dataset of chest radiographs and radiology reports. It contains 377,110 images corresponding to 227,835 radiology reports. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through the PhysioNet website https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/.


## Data splitting file
When training different modules, we apply different split of the dataset, resulting in differernt meta data files. Due to the size of the files, the data split files are not uploaded to the repository. Please download the files from the following links and place them in the corresponding folders https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hQydkKn4uAKbh781AlKjNMeqmTHE1LQ7/view?usp=drive_link.
